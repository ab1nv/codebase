# Codebase
Organised collection of my solutions to Leetcode, Codeforces and Advent of Code in languages I like, with best practices and full test coverage.

This repo contains my solutions to the problemsets with intuition in `README` file in each problem's directory. I knew this repo, with time, would be very large in size to search through and maintain, that's why I created a couple of [handy scripts](./scripts/) that autogenerate this README for me. 

### 1. Navigating
The find command is your best friend here. :) Nevertheless, if you are looking to browse through the indexes, they are linked below.

→ [Codeforces Index](https://github.com/ab1nv/codebase?tab=readme-ov-file#4a-leetcode)
→ [Advent of Code Index](https://github.com/ab1nv/codebase?tab=readme-ov-file#4a-leetcode)

### 2. Contributing
If you find any errors in my solutions listed here or have ideas to implement them in better ways, feel free to open a PR. Documentation changes are also welcome.
