# Codebase
Organized collection of my solutions to Leetcode, Codeforces, and Advent of Code in languages I like, following best practices with full test coverage.

This repo contains my solutions to the problem sets, along with intuition, in the `README` file of each problem's directory. I knew that this repo would, over time, become very large and difficult to search through and maintain, so I created a couple of [handy scripts]() that automatically generate this README for me.

### 1. Navigating
The find command is your best friend here. :) Nevertheless, if you're looking to browse, the indexes are linked below:
→ [Leetcode Index](https://github.com/ab1nv/codebase?tab=readme-ov-file#3a-leetcode)
→ [Codeforces Index](https://github.com/ab1nv/codebase?tab=readme-ov-file#3b-codeforces)
→ [Advent of Code Index](https://github.com/ab1nv/codebase?tab=readme-ov-file#3c-advent-of-code)

### 2. Contributing
If you find any errors in my solutions listed here or have suggestions for better implementations, feel free to open a PR. Documentation changes are also welcome.
