# Codebase
Organised collection of solutions to Leetcode, Codeforces, Advent of Code, etc in languages I like.

This repo contains solutions to the problems with my own intuition in the `README` file in each problem's directory. I knew this README, with time, would be very large in size to search through or maintain, that's why I created a couple of [handy scripts](./scripts/) that autogenerate this README for me.
