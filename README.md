# Codebase
Organised collection of solved problemsets for Leetcode, Codeforces, Advent of Code, etc in many different languages.

This repo contains solutions to the problems with my own intuition in the `README` file in each problem's directory. I knew this README, with time, would be very large in size to search through or maintain, that's why I created a handful of [handy scripts](./scripts/) that autogenerate this README for me.

Problems to Leetcode and Codeforces are in the `[leetcode/](./leetcode/)` and `[codeforces/](./codeforces/) directory respectively
